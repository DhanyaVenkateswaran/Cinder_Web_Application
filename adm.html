                            <li> <strong>JEE :</strong><br>
                                <br>The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is an engineering entrance assessment conducted for admission to various engineering colleges in India. It is constituted by two different examinations: the JEE Main and the JEE
                                Advanced. The Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) conducts the joint admission process for a total of 23 Indian Institute of Technology campuses, 31 National Institute of Technology campuses, 25 Indian Institute of

                            </li>
                            <li> <strong> NEET :</strong> <br><br> The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) (or NEET (UG)), formerly the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT), is an all India pre-medical entrance test for students who wish to
                                pursue undergraduate medical (MBBS), dental (BDS) and equivalent AYUSH (BAMS, BUMS, BHMS, etc.) courses in government and private institutions in India and also, for those intending to pursue primary medical qualification
                                abroad.

                        <br> Certain Colleges may have an Interview in addition to the Entrance test so it is necessary to check your Registered Email daily to not miss out on anything.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> The Result </h4>
                    <p> Most Colleges will have a Relative grading system where each student's profile and grades will be compared with other students of the admission pool. The students will be notified of the result within a week or two. If the student
                        gets selected, He/She will be asked to submit the original documents and pay the fees to reserve their seat. <br> It is important for Students who get rejected to not get dejected as some colleges give preference to certain people
                        because of their special skills or even due to their seat allocation structure. So, Chin Up Hunter!
